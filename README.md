## About
This is a social media sports-themed website I made using solely HTML and CSS. Specifically, it is a landing page for a user
profile, loosely based off a Facebook profile page. The purpose of this project is to show case aesthetic and user-friendly design. There is no Javascript used in this iteration, so the buttons do not currently do anything, and all 'data' on the page
is hardcoded, as there is no backend

## Features
1. Intutitive and Engaging Site Layout
2. Aesthetic on hover Animations

## Future Iterations
I believe there is much potential to expand on this project, in terms of seeing out the actual idea of the website, as well as
making it truly interactive.

Technical Development:
1. Primarily, I would like to add a backend along with user-authentication to enable interaction between users.
2. Along with authentication, I would like to add CRUD resource functionality so users can post pictures, comments, and interact with one another's activity.
3. I also like to make a mobile version of the website. While the site can be used on mobile without issues, it is not formatted
for mobile.

General Development:
In general, the direciton for this site in the future is meant to aim for some iteration of Twitter and ESPN combined - something like an interactive sports site that incorporates actual statistics that can be referenced in posts.

1. I would love to create and build upon a database on players that users can individually rank, which in turn create a site-wide ranking. Rankings per sport category would then be displayed in the rankings tab, based on how many users have ranked/favorited players.
2. The global channel would function much like Twitter, with a global news feed of some kind. This would likely be based on
user interactions with certain posts, as well as posts from highly followed accounts.
3. The news tab would be a newsfeed of player and team-based current news, descending by most recent. This would function much like ESPN Fantasy Apps re: player news. Example: imgur link.
4. Lastly, I would each sport to be categorized and have their own landing page with news and recent posts. This would be accessed through the profile sidebar, which currently shows buttons for chosen favorite sports, with an button to add additional
favorites.
